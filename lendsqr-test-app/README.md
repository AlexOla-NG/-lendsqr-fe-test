## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a challenging project for me. It was the first time I'd build a landing page. The project took longer than I expected it to, and I think the most important lesson this has taught me is to plan. Plan the layout of the project; identify components that look similar, assign them like classes to reduce extra work in css. I spent so much time on cssðŸ’€.

It was worth it though, I was able to grasp certain concepts better. For example, the difference between child and descendant selectors; grid-auto-flow; manipulating bg images; transition and its limitations. For JS, I think I understand hoisting and closures a bit better now. For HTML, I tried to use semantic tags and set alt attribute of placeholder img tags to role=presentation

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img
  class="thumbnails"
  src="./images/image-plane.jpg"
  alt="role=presentation"
/>
```

```css
.social-logo > img {
  transition: filter var(--ease-transition);
}

.social-logo > img:hover {
  filter: invert(68%) sepia(92%) saturate(425%) hue-rotate(75deg) brightness(
      89%
    ) contrast(85%);
  cursor: pointer;
}

.footer-nav-list {
  grid-column: 4 / span 4;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 0.5fr);
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  column-gap: 1em;
}
```

```js
hamburger.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (!menuOpen) {
    hamburger.setAttribute("src", "./images/icon-close.svg");
    navList.classList.toggle("show");
    menuOpen = true;
  } else {
    hamburger.setAttribute("src", "./images/icon-hamburger.svg");
    navList.classList.toggle("show");
    menuOpen = false;
  }
});
```

### Continued development

I still need more practice using grids, but I've come to appreciate the full control it gives me in layout.

I also need more practice with JS hoisting and closures. I think there are certain use cases that I need to understand.

### Useful resources

- [Simple Search Bar by Emily Huang](https://codepen.io/huange/pen/bGqMqM?editors=1100) - This helped me quickly build the searchbar.
- [Format Numbers with Commas in JavaScript](https://sabe.io/blog/javascript-format-numbers-commas#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20format,format%20the%20number%20with%20commas.) - This helped me understand how to add commas to numbers (eg 1,000 1,000,000) in JavaScript.
- [Styling HTML tables with CSS - Web Design/UX Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biI9OFH6Nmg) - This helped me easily apply CSS styles to a table.
- [:last-of-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) - This helped me select the last tr element in a table. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [HEX to Filter converter for SVG](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me easily change the color of SVG icons in img tag. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks goes to Lamide for her hack on adjusting img height with CSS classes (I didn't think it would work, but it did!ðŸ˜‚). It helped adjust the disparate image heights of .thumbnails. Saved me weeks of headache
